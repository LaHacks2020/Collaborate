# Collaborate
A new way to collaborate with your colleagues and organizing your meetings.

## Usage
A web platform which not only enables users to organize all their virtual meetings wiin an organization, company or a startup but more importantly helps them to get to know the fellow participants before they virtually start a meeting with them. This will help prevent strange culture within the the comany where employees are still getting to know each other in first couple of minutes and then starting the meeting. 
As if now-a-days situation people are only able to meet virtual. In big organization the meeting could be from 10 people to 200 people conference. Alot of their emplooyees joing the meeting do not know about 80% of the employees joing those big meetings. So we created a platform for emplooyees to use in an organization where 

• After logging it :The employee who is logging in would be able to see their own profile and edit it. See how many meetings they have coming up, they connections within the organization, tasks completed.

• They can see upcoming meeting on their portal whichh includes mandatory meetings(ex: Daily Stand up meeting) + optional meetings(ex: abstract card meeting). 

• Recommended Events: If the user clicks on the photo of the upcoming events, then it will take user to a place where they can see more deatils about upcoming event and that page will also have recomened events for them.

• Join the Meeting: There is begin button for meeting is only enables if metting is starting in 30 mins for you to join the call. If meeting is in 2 days then the begin button is disable until you approach withi 30 min time frame. 

• See who is Joining:This is crucial because if employees et to know fellow employees' who are joing the meeting their rolr, skills, interests and also can connect with them or ask for them just get to know them because the upcoming meeting. 

• User can also see where the other employees are meeting joining from. for Example one employee could be joing from California, other from New York, someone from Singapore, India or Africa.

• Within user portal, user have option to host the meeting as well. If the user choose to host the meeting then it will take user to a form where they fill out the data, time and purpose of the meeting and choose the people within the organization whom the user wants to join their meeting.
